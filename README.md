## 📊 **Dataset Description**  

- **Size**: `1,297,443 rows × 39 columns`  
- **Key Features**:  
  - `Category`, `IncidentGrade`, `EntityType`, `Hour`, `DayOfWeek`, etc.  
- **Target Variable Distribution**:  
  - `BenignPositive`: 2,054,774  
  - `TruePositive`: 1,662,087  
  - `FalsePositive`: 1,015,782  

🚨 **Missing Values**:  
- Dropped columns with >50% missing values: `ActionGrouped`, `ResourceType`.  
- Imputed numerical and categorical columns using median/mode.

## 🛠️ **Preprocessing Steps**  

**Data Cleaning**:  
- Removed duplicates.  
- Handled missing values with imputation.  

**Outlier Removal**:  
- Used IQR method for numerical features.  

**Feature Engineering**:  
- Extracted temporal features like `Year`, `Month`, `Hour`, `DayOfWeek`.  
- Encoded categorical features with Label and One-Hot Encoding.  

**Scaling**:  
- Applied Min-Max Scaling to numerical features.
